CVE: CVE-2011-1452
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 451
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2011-05-03 18:55:01.903000000 -04:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The vulnerability was in the URL bar which could allow an attacker to spoof a 
  site being visited.
  
  The implementation makes use of how a NaviagationEntry works by terminating a 
  URL refresh before it is complete. This results in a page that can seemingly 
  have a different URl than the one it is supposed to have. At best, a menial 
  page may be spoofed. At worst, this vulnerablity can lead to targeted phishing
  attempts and the theft of valuble information.
  
  The way this could be exploited is if an attacker created a site identical to 
  the site they wanted to spoof. Then by using a javascript timer cause a redirect 
  to the link to be spoof to be canceled there by having the URL navigation bar
  update it's contents to display the URL of the legitimate website while not on it.
  This is possible with phishing attacks, or if someone accidentally clicks on a 
  malicious link.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    From looking at the fixed code and seeing that there's only the difference 
    of a single line of code and a comment. It's unclear if they used unit tests
    for the fix since it was so simple.
  code: false
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    I checked the Chromium bug report and it seems that it was found manually. The user
    who found the vulnerability was able to construct various potential exploits of this
    vulnerability before it was patched.
  date: 2001-03-29
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: based off chromium bugs page.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
  commits:
  - commit: 724159ade73d3b63a41778a8dbb0a39751561ee3 
    note: |
      The one developer that worked on this commit was working on integrating the finding 
      and dispaching of messages directly into the tabContent and in doing so changed a sizable 
      portion of the code in the related file by adding 186 lines and removing 159 lines of code.
  - commit: 18ba2b1b755ee5964255b81297698f395722bf7a
    note: |
      The developer removed a single line of code in this commit to correct the vulnerablity 
      because the that line had created a redundancy in the code where it was returning information
      that was already being retrived in another location in the code.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: The vulnerability was introduced by a single developer in a commit that had affected 13 separate files.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      The vulnerability was based on the fact that the same process was technically being 
      completed twice in different locations of the code since it would update the URL twice.
      Which allowed for interupts to be placed and manipulate the behavior of the function.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The coding mistake made was repetition in behavior because there was a varible set before
    it was determined that it is the proper URL. The mistake was in assuming that when a redirection
    happens the page navigation would change before the full page reload. 
    
    The vulnerability was introduced in one commit by a single developer while tring to change 
    functionality of the system. The vulnerability was introduced by a single line of code
    that added more functionallity than neccesary in that situation.
